                                    Medical loans are unsecured loans you can use to fund your medical costs that cannot be 
                                    covered by your health insurance. The loan can be used for medical emergencies, surgeries 
                                    or chronic illnesses. 
                                </p>

                                    Medical bills in Singapore can be expensive, and loaning from a bank may require long 
                                    waiting hours before your aplication is approved. Even so, banks may not approve of your 
                                    loan due to low income or credit score. Thus, Singapore Money Lender offers access to all 
                                    in getting a medical loan under 5 minutes.

                                    Longing for a break? Vacation loans are personal loans that can help you get to your 
                                    dream destination. They can be customised to suit your travelling and accommodation needs.

                                    We understand that saving up for a vacation with your family or friends can be difficult. 
                                    Loaning from a bank or using credit cards may be expensive as well. That’s why Singapore 
                                    Money Lender offers flexible packages to cater to your travelling plans.
